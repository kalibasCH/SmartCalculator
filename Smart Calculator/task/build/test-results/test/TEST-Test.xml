It means that from now on the program must receive the addition + 
and subtraction - operators as an input to distinguish operations from each other. 
It must support both unary and binary minus operators. Moreover, If the user has entered 
several same operators following each other, the program still should work 
(like Java or Python REPL). Also, as you remember from school math, two adjacent minus 
signs turn into a plus. Therefore, if the user inputs --, it should be read as +; if they 
input ----, it should be read as ++, and so on. The smart calculator ought to have such 
a feature.
