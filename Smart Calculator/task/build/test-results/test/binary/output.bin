CIt means that from now on the program must receive the addition + 
Tand subtraction - operators as an input to distinguish operations from each other. 
ZIt must support both unary and binary minus operators. Moreover, If the user has entered 
Lseveral same operators following each other, the program still should work 
X(like Java or Python REPL). Also, as you remember from school math, two adjacent minus 
[signs turn into a plus. Therefore, if the user inputs --, it should be read as +; if they 
Yinput ----, it should be read as ++, and so on. The smart calculator ought to have such 
a feature.
